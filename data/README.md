## Prepare dataset 

Download [FFHQ](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset) dataset and unzip it to the `/data/ffhq` directory. 

Download [age label](https://partage.imt.fr/index.php/s/nBCzEqi3KgSp276) to the `/data` directory.

## Training on your own dataset

You can also train the model with your own dataset. Put your images in the `/data` directory. Modify the dataset path in `train.py`. With the pretrained classifier, you can create a new label file with the age of each image.
